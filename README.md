# everhour-client
A react-native applications for controlling time logs.  
I know we have a desktop extension but still it's so small, at times I forget to stop and my time sums up to 36h :sweat_smile: 

This appliaction uses [Everhour API](https://everhour.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/getting-started) which is currently in beta so API response may change , but still I would update on any change.
